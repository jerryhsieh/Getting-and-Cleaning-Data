2. run_analysis.R : R script that clean the above datasets and generate tidy dataset (tidy.csv) for further process, copy this script to / and then source("run_analysis.R")


3. tidy.csv: a tidy dataset after raw datasets processed by run_analysis.R

4. CodeBook.md: file to describe run_analysis.R 

5. Readme.md: This file
